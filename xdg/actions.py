"""
Implementation of the XDG MIME actions draft
http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Specifications/mime-actions-spec

The implementation is in two parts:
 - mimeinfo.cache, which is autogenerated by update-desktop-database
   and contains a single-file cache of all desktop files
 - mimeapps.list, which contains user associations, exclusions and
   default apps

-> A user association is an association between an app and, for
   example, a MIME type, which the user has added themselves.
-> A user exclusion is an application association which has been
   rejected by the user (marked as invalid; eg "Never present this
   option again)
-> The default application is an application that has been set as
   the default to be used when executing a specific action.
